**_MY PORTFOLIO_**

This project is a portfolio that shows some of my recent achievements.

**DESIGN PROCESS**

I created this website as a portfolio for myself. The goal was to make it look simple. It is also meant to show my personality

User Stories:

1. As a website user, I want to be able to use buttons to navigate to different pages of the website.
2. As an employer, I want to see the capabilities of the web designer to see if I should hire the web designer.
3. As an employer/general user, I want to be able to contact the web designer to get to know more about them.
4. As an employer/general user, I want to get to know more about the web designer so I can understand more about their
   background.
